# Automata Theory Final Project
In this project, we developed a web-based solution for converting non-deterministic finite automatas into its equivalent deterministic finite automata.
You can see a live demo of this in action here: https://johnlfx.github.io/Automata-NFA-to-DFA/

# Report
The report describes our process and implementation in detail. You can find our report in the [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) file.
We also presented our project to the rest of the class. You can find our PowerPoint slides in the Presentation [pptx](Presentation.pptx) or [pdf](Presentation.pdf) file.
